A mod for Baldur’s Gate 3 that replaces British English with the far better US English. F**k yeah!

## Impetus
I didn’t think it could bother me, but I quickly became tired of seeing screen after screen of “armour” and “colour”. So I decided to take matters into my own hands.

At first, I was skeptical, as it was an ardorous endeavor, laboring over tons of unforgivable and unsavory words. However, I realized the file was reconcilable, skillfully utilizing my marvelous judgment.

(I feel better now!)

## Goals
* Provide American spellings of English words instead of their British counterparts.
* Don’t change words in the dialogue (dialog?) so it still matches the audio.

## Notes
The entire mod is just a localizaton patch for `English.pak`. All the strings in the game are in a localization file. Loading this mod patches, or overwrites the existing strings.

This project is both a record on which strings to change in the localization file, and a compiled `.pak` mod for people to download and install with all the changes.

## Contribute
If you’d like to contribute, you must first pronounce the word “contribute” with the stress on the second syllable. Then create an issue or a pull request. Bonus points if you can identify the “contentuid” of the line to change.
